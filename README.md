# Data visualization on lifespan variations by lifestyle
 This project was requested by PhD. Avi Roy, head of the Growing Life institution, where I am member of. Based on the golden ratio, I designed the concept in Adobe Illustrator 2021. Then, I used Javascript, together with SVG and Vue 3, to implement it. I want to thanks Manuel Temple who helped me debugging my code every time I've got stucked.
